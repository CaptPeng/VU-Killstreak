# VU-Killstreak
This Mod add Killstreaks to BF3.

The UI is made with React. To develop you need NodeJS and npm installed on you System.
On first use go into the UI Folder and type in the command line "npm install" to install all dependencies
then you can run the UI on your local System with "npm run start"

Currently only a static UI is available and the Lua-Script is in construction.
